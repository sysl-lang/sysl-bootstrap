 *
 * Scala Native's Immix GC reads `GC_MAXIMUM_HEAP_SIZE` from the environment at GC init — before
 * `main` runs — and defaults to **unlimited** when it is absent (`Settings_MaxHeapSize` in the
 * runtime's own `gc/immix/Settings.c`, answering `UNLIMITED_HEAP_SIZE` from `Constants.h`). So an
 * installed compiler run on a large program grows until it meets physical memory rather than
 * collecting, which is what a hosted runner's `Out of heap space grow heap` is. There is no
 * link-time hook for this default: the setting is read directly from the environment by C code
 * this project does not own, and Scala Native's `NativeConfig` has nothing that reaches it.
 *
 * So the ceiling is set here, in the compiler's own entry point, before anything of size has been
 * allocated: `setenv` the default, then **re-exec this same binary with the same arguments**.
 * `execv` replaces the process image outright rather than forking a child, so stdin, stdout,
 * stderr and the eventual exit status all carry through unchanged — there is no parent left
 * to relay them. The child inherits the environment `setenv` just mutated, so its own GC sees
 * `GC_MAXIMUM_HEAP_SIZE` already set and `heapCeilingDecision` is what stops a second re-exec:
 * the guard and the fix are the same environment variable.
 *
 * A build that cannot resolve its own path — `executablePath` answers `None` off this platform's
 * mac/Linux pair, which is every target this compiler ships for — falls back to a PATH lookup of
 * its own command name, and running under neither leaves the process to start uncapped rather
 * than fail outright: growing without bound is the defect this exists to fix, not one worth
 * trading for a compiler that will not start at all.
