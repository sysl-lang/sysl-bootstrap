// Where a publish goes, and there are two answers because Central is slow.
//
// Central is the real one: it is what anybody depending on sysl resolves from, and a release is not
// a release until it is there. But it can take hours to propagate, and `~/dev/sysl.sh` — which
// compiles every fenced block on every page against a *released* compiler — cannot write a line of
// documentation for a release until it can resolve one. GitHub Packages answers in minutes, so the
// same artifacts go there too and the site can be written while Central catches up.
//
// Gated on an environment variable rather than a separate task, matching `SYSL_RELEASE`: one
// `publishTo`, switched, so there is no second configuration to drift.
//
//     sbt publishSigned                      # Central, 1 of 2 — stages locally, uploads nothing
//     sbt sonatypeBundleRelease              # Central, 2 of 2 — the upload, and the release
//     SYSL_PUBLISH_GITHUB=1 sbt publish      # GitHub Packages, the head start
//
// `publishSigned` alone publishes nothing: it writes the signed artifacts under
// `target/sonatype-staging/` and prints a `published … to <local path>` line for each, then exits
// successfully in about a second. `sonatypeBundleRelease` is what uploads the bundle and polls until
// the deployment reports `PUBLISHED`.
//
// **This does not shorten the release and must never be allowed to stand in for it.** A GitHub
// Packages copy makes a downstream build succeed whether or not the Central upload worked, which is
// the same masking that rules out `publishLocal` — so the Central check against `maven-metadata.xml`
// stays exactly as mandatory as it was.
