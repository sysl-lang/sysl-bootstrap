 * the places it looked.

 * separately is the **diagnostic** — a command that is not there and a command that ran and failed
 * are different things to say to somebody, and going through the process API answers both with one
 * `IOException`.
 *
 * Executability is part of the question rather than an extra check. A directory named like the
 * command, or a file somebody forgot to `chmod +x`, is not a command — and finding one would stop
 * the search at something that cannot run while a real one sat further down the PATH.
 *
 * The `.exe` spelling is tried second so that Windows works without a separate code path and no
