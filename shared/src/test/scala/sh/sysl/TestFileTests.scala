/** `@tests` — a file of a module's test scaffolding, kept by `sysl test` and dropped by every other
 * build (`reference/attributes.md § @tests — a file of scaffolding`).
 *
 * The header says two things and both are pinned here, because either alone is unsound. It **drops**
 * the file, which is what keeps a helper out of a program and out of a library's artifact; and it
 * **restricts** who may name what the file declared, which is what makes dropping it safe rather
 * than a link error waiting for whoever writes the reference.
 *
 * The restriction is stated over the referring *declaration* and not over the file it sits in, and
 * the case that forces it is the one `reference/attributes.md § @tests — a file of scaffolding` asks for: a `@test` written beside what it tests,
 * in an ordinary file, calling scaffolding from the test file. A rule about files would refuse that
 * and drive every test out of the module's real files.
