/** The standard module handed to a compilation as an **artifact** rather than as source, and the one
 * claim that has to hold before anything is moved onto that path: that the two mean the same thing.
 *
 * A program is compiled against the library (`reference/modules.md § Separate compilation`), and
 * every compilation so far has been handed it the same way — `library/sysl` as the compiler embeds
 * it, parsed. The artifact exists to end that source dependence: the same trees arrive already
 * decoded, and the half with nothing left to monomorphize arrives as object code to link against
 * rather than emit again.
 *
 * **"It links" would prove nothing on its own.** A compilation that reached a *different* library
 * and still produced a program that linked would be exactly as green. So what is pinned here is the
 * emitted IR, compared **byte for byte** between a compilation against the embedded std and one
 * against the decoded artifact, over programs chosen to reach as much of the library as they can.
 * That is a stronger statement than any behavioural test could make, and it is cheap: the IR is a
 * string, so nothing here needs a toolchain.
 *
 * The order matters as much as the assertion. Nothing has moved onto the artifact path yet — the
 * whole suite still compiles the library from source, and this is the test that says it *could*.
 * Writing it first is what keeps the move from being a switch: a switch would put every program onto
 * a path nothing had exercised, where one hole fails everything at once with nothing to bisect.
