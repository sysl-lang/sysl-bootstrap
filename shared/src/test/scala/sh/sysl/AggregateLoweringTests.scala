/** How a **large** aggregate is handed about (`Layout.indirect`).
 *
 * A small one is a value: LLVM carries it in registers, and the `insertvalue` and `extractvalue`
 * instructions that build and read one cost nothing. Above `Layout.DirectBytes` that stops being
 * true — the back end is copying memory whatever the IR says, and a first-class value only obliges
 * every pass to reason about each byte of it. `guide/kernel` builds a 20 KB struct and hands it
 * about at thirty-five call sites; that module took 408 seconds to compile at `-O1` as a value and
 * 0.93 seconds through memory.
 *
 * So there are four lowerings here rather than one, and the tests come in pairs: what a large
 * aggregate does, and that a small one still does what it always did. A threshold with only one
 * side tested is a threshold that could be anywhere.
