 * may be is here, and how a run of them is read — including the recovering pass that skips the ones
 * it cannot read — is there, because that is the only rule the `recovering` flag reaches.
 *
 * A **declaration** is here rather than in `DeclParser` where a declaration's own body is read,
 * because at the top of a file the two are one thing (`reference/modules.md § Where a program starts`): `declaration` is an alternative of
 * `statement`, and which of the two a line turns out to be is the analyzer's question rather than
 * the grammar's. What `DeclParser` holds is the shape *inside* a declaration — a parameter list, a
 * struct's fields, a trait's members.
