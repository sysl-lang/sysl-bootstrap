   * The pattern is [[destructuring]], which is what a `val` or a `var` binding takes, so there is
   * one rule rather than two: a `for` binds what a binding binds — a tuple, a struct, either of
   * those named with `n @`, nested as deep as the value goes, and a variant pattern parsed only so
   * that it can be refused with a reason. Nothing about the loop had to learn any of that.
   *
   * **A pattern is desugared here, into the binding the reader would otherwise have written.** The
   * loop names a temporary no program can write, and the body opens with the pattern bound to it:
   *
   * ```
   * for (k, v) in walk()            for $elem in walk()
   *     print(k)             -->        var (k, v) = $elem

   * difference.
   *
   * **The synthesized binding is stamped with the pattern's own position**, which is what keeps the
   * desugaring from showing through: `for (a, b) in 0..<n` is answered *"one int is not something to
   * take apart"* under the `(` in the header, and not against a line the reader did not write.
   *
   * The parts are `var` rather than `val` because the loop variable itself is one — a `for` may
   * assign to what it named, and taking the value apart should not quietly take that away.
   *
   * **The two forms cannot be confused for one another**: every alternative of `destructuring`
   * needs a `(` or a `{` where a plain loop has its `in`, so `for x in xs` never reaches the
   * pattern path and parses exactly as it always did.
