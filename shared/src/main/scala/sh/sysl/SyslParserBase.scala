/** What every part of the grammar stands on: the token reader, position stamping, the terminal
 * matchers, and the handful of shapes that recur at every level — a comma list, a soft word, an
 * indented suite, an `end` marker.
 *
 * It also declares, abstractly, the rules that are reached **across** the grammar's areas. A
 * language's grammar is not a tree of independent parts: an expression may be an `if` whose branches
 * are statements, a statement may be a declaration whose body is statements again, and a type appears
 * inside all three. Splitting the grammar across files therefore has to name those crossings rather
 * than pretend they do not exist, and naming them here is what lets each area be read on its own —
 * the list below *is* the coupling, in full, and nothing outside it reaches sideways.
 *
 * The traits are mixed in one order — `ExprParser`, then `DeclParser` and the areas beside it, then
 * `StmtParser`, `ControlFlowParser`, and `SyslParser` itself — so a rule needs a declaration here
 * only when it is used by an area that comes **before** the one that defines it. That is why the
 * list is shorter than the number of crossings.
 *
 * **The order is part of the specification, so a new area goes in at the position whose rules it
 * took.** `StmtParser` and `ControlFlowParser` were both carved out of `SyslParser`'s own body and
 * are mixed in exactly where that body sat, which is what makes the split a move rather than a
 * change: the linearization every rule resolves against is the one it resolved against before.

   * belongs when the node is wrong. The extent answers a different question, asked by an editor
   * rather than by a reader: which construct is the cursor inside. `xs.foo(1)` points at `foo` and
   * covers all of `xs.foo(1)`.
   *
   * Because `setPos` keeps the first position it is given (`Positioned`), wrapping an outer rule
   * never overwrites what an inner one already recorded — so a rule that merely passes its
   * operand through costs nothing, and only the rule that actually built the node decides where
   * it points. `p` is by-name so a rule may wrap a `lazy val` declared later in the file.
   *
   * **That is also what keeps an extent honest rather than merely large.** An inner rule finishes
   * before the rule around it, so it stamps first, and a precedence ladder passing one operand up
   * through a dozen levels leaves the operand spanning itself rather than spanning the ladder. A
   * node's span therefore grows to the whole construct exactly when the construct is what was
   * built — a call, a binding, a binary operation — and no further.
   *
   * **The node is stamped in place and `p`'s own result is handed back**, rather than a fresh
   * `Success` around it. A `Success` carries the furthest failure the parse reached on its way here
   * (`lastFailure`), which is what a parser that backtracks and then succeeds knows about the file
   * and nothing else does — and it is what `phrase` reports when the whole parse stops short. That
   * field has no public constructor, so rebuilding the result silently emptied it: every rule in the
   * grammar is wrapped in this one, so what survived to be reported was whatever failed *outside*
   * the outermost `at`, which is a position near the top of the file rather than near the mistake.
   *
   * **A failure the rule did not get past is dropped, and only one further on is kept.** A rule that
   * ends in an optional tail — `logicalOr ~ assignOp ~ expression | logicalOr`, or any `opt` — leaves
   * behind a failure at exactly the token it stopped before, saying which of the tail's spellings it
   * looked for last. That is a road not taken rather than a reason, and it is at the position the
   * enclosing rule is about to complain about itself, with a message about what it actually wanted.
   * `val x = 1 2` reported `'>>=' expected` from an assignment nobody was writing; the token the
   * statement wanted there is a newline, and dropping the road not taken is what lets it say so.
