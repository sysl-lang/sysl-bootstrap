/** `sysl build-c` — the static archive and the C header a C project is handed (`reference/ffi.md §
 * @export`).
 *
 * **This is `build-lib`'s shape with a different destination.** The compilation is the ordinary one
 * rather than a library build, because what is wanted is a module lowered for *this* target with its
 * calls resolved, not a tree of declarations somebody else will compile. What differs from `build`
 * is the entry point, which `cLibrary` above suppressed, and the ending: an archive rather than a
 * link.
 *
 * **The standard module is compiled into the archive**, always, and this is the one thing `build-c`
 * decides differently from every other command. A `.syslib` is not something a C project can link:
 * an archive referring to code no reachable file contains fails at the C link naming `sysl$prints`,
 * which is a symbol its author has no way to place. So the archive stands alone or it is not an
 * artifact. See `stdChoice`.
 *
 * **What is NOT in the archive is what this build's own libraries supply** — `libm`, and whatever
 * `@link` named — and the report says so rather than leaving it to be discovered at the C project's
 * link. Those are libraries the author chose and can be given to a linker, which is exactly the
 * distinction the standard module fails.
 *
 * **`roots` is every tree the compilation walked, not the project's own**, and it is a parameter
 * for that reason. `reference/ffi.md § A library may carry C` gives a source root named with
 * `--lib` and a package a `dependencies` block brought in the same answer as the project itself:
 * their C is compiled and reaches the link. This command reads that table exactly as
 * `NativeSources` does for the commands that link, and the archive is where "the link line" lands
 * when the consumer is a C project — an object the archive left out is one the C author has no way
 * to supply and no way to hear about, since the sysl half compiled cleanly and only the C project's
 * linker ever notices.
