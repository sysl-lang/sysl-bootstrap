 * `IndentationLexical`; everything sysl-specific is here: the token ADT, the literal
 * grammar, the reserved words, and the closed operator set.
 *
 * The token types are declared inside the class because `scala-parser-combinators`
 * makes `Token` path-dependent — a parser sees them as `lexical.IntLit` and friends.
 *
 * Literals carry their *value*, not a tagged string: an `IntLit` holds a `BigInt`
 * because the integer family is arbitrary-width, and a `FloatLit` holds its text
 * because `f128` does not fit a `Double`. Widening either later is then a matter of
 * the analyzer, not of re-lexing.

  /** The operators that carry an expression onto the next line.
   *
   * A bracketed expression already continues, because `(`, `[` and `{` suspend the off-side rule
   * until they close. What was missing is the unbracketed case, and the rule is the narrowest one
   * that covers it: **an operator that cannot finish an expression continues the line.** After any
   * of these something must follow, so a newline there cannot have been the end of a statement and
   * there is nothing to be ambiguous about.
   *
   * That rule decides the exclusions rather than a taste for which operators look right:
   *
   *   - **`=` and `->`** are left out although they are binary, because both already open an
   *     indented block — a function body, a match arm — and a token cannot mean "the block starts
   *     here" and "the line goes on" at once.
   *   - **`++`, `--` and `?`** are postfix, so a line ending in one is a complete statement.
   *   - **`..`, `..<` and `...`** are left out because they too can be complete: `s[..]` is the
   *     whole range and `int...` is a variadic tail.
   *
   * **`*` needed the exception removed rather than taken.** A wildcard import is a whole statement
   * whose text ends in a `*`, so continuing there joined the import to the declaration after it —
   * eighteen tests said so. The fix is not to drop multiplication from the set, which would leave
   * the rule with an arbitrary hole, and not to respell the wildcard: it is to lex `.*` as one
   * token, above. A `.` is only ever followed by a name, so nothing else can produce that pair, and
   * a line then never ends in a bare `*` that was really the end of a statement.
   *   - **`.`** is left out because the continuation style worth having for a call chain puts the
   *     dot at the *start* of the following line, which needs the opposite mechanism — and now has
   *     one, in `isLineContinuationStart` below. A trailing `.` remains an error, deliberately: two
   *     ways to write one chain is a style argument in every file that has one.
   *   - **`,`, `:` and `;`** are separators, and the only one with a real customer (`,`) already
   *     continues wherever it appears, since an argument list is bracketed.
   *
   * Prefix operators are in: `!`, `~` and the unary readings of `-`, `*` and `&` cannot finish an
   * expression either, and leaving them out would make the rule a list to memorize instead of a
   * rule.
   *
   * The one hazard is the one every joining language has, including the brackets sysl already
   * joins on: a continuation line that is *dedented* has its dedent swallowed with the newline, so
   * a trailing operator can silently hold a block open. It is written down here rather than
   * guarded against, because guarding would mean the indentation of a continuation line carried
   * meaning, and the point of continuing is that it does not.

   *
   * This is the other half of the rule above, and it exists because a *chain* is the one expression
   * people habitually break across lines, and the break they write is before the dot rather than
   * after it:
   *
   * {{{
   * val face = text(label)
   *     .foreground(WHITE)
   *     .padding(8)
   *     .background(ground, radius)
   * }}}
   *
   * Every language with a fluent surface reads that shape — Scala, Kotlin, Swift, C# — and a
   * language whose interface toolkit is built out of chained modifiers cannot ask for it on one
   * line: the four links above are 92 characters together, and there is no operator at the end of
   * any of them for the trailing rule to see.
   *
   * **A name after the dot is required, and that is the whole safety argument.** A continued line's
   * own margin is discarded, so a rule that fired on something which could also *begin* a statement
   * would pull the line into the block above and move where that block ends. Nothing in the
   * expression grammar begins a statement with `.`, and requiring a letter or `_` after it excludes
   * everything else spelled with one: `..` and `..<` are ranges, `...` is a variadic tail, `.0` is a
   * tuple index, and `.*` is an import wildcard. None of those can start a line either, but the
   * predicate does not have to know that — it never sees them.
   *
   * The one thing it deliberately does not do is join a line beginning with an *operator*. `+` and
   * friends already continue from the end of the previous line, and a language that accepted both
   * ends would be asking every file to pick a side.
   *
   * **AND THE LINE ABOVE HAS TO ADMIT IT, WHICH LOOKAHEAD ALONE CANNOT SEE.** sysl has one other
   * construct spelled with a leading dot — the **implicit member** (`.Red`, whose type comes from
   * what the context expects) — and a `match` arm's pattern begins a line:
   *
   * {{{
   * val n = c match
   *     .Red -> 1
   * }}}
   *
   * Joined, that reads as `c match .Red`, and the reader who wrote the form they had just been
   * taught gets `newline expected` instead of the sentence `PatternParser.noImplicitMember` exists to
   * give them. So the rule asks both ends, which is the exact dual of the trailing one above: a
   * trailing operator continues because it **cannot** finish an expression, and a leading dot
   * continues only where the line above **could** have.
   *
   * A reserved word cannot finish one — there is nothing to call a method on — so `match`, `then`,
   * `else`, `do` and the rest all decline, and no call chain is lost, because none of them can be a
   * receiver. The four that *are* values are the exception, and `self` is the one that matters:
   * `self` on its own line with `.field` under it is an ordinary chain.
   *
   * **What this does NOT rescue is the second arm**, whose line above ends in whatever the first
   * arm's value was — an ordinary expression, which admits the join. That is the residual cost, and
   * it is bounded by the fact that an implicit member in a pattern is *illegal in sysl either way*:
   * what is lost is the quality of a diagnostic, never the meaning of a legal program.

   * is the only thing saying where the block ends, so the newline, indent and dedent have to be
   * emitted after all — and without them a `match` written as an argument was refused with
   * *newline expected*, pointing at its first arm.

   *
   * **Both tokens are here because one of them would be a rule nobody could state.** A `match` opens
   * its arms and an arrow opens a closure's body or an arm's, and a language admitting the first as
   * an argument and refusing the second asks a reader to remember which block forms may be written
   * where. What is worth saying instead is that a block opens wherever it is written:
   *
   * {{{
   * print(n match                    xs.each((x) ->
   *     0 -> "none"                      val doubled = x * 2

   * **Neither can finish an expression**, which is the safety condition — the same one the leading-dot
   * rule turns on from the other side. A token that could end one would make the *next* line's margin
   * significant in an argument list, which is exactly what the bracket rule exists to prevent.
   *
   * `then`, `else` and `do` are deliberately absent. Each opens a block too, so the rule would admit
   * them — but an `if` written across lines as an argument puts its `else` back at the outer margin,
   * which is a dedent the enclosing bracket has to swallow rather than one the block owns, and that
