   * **The cases are told apart inside one lookahead rather than by separate alternatives**, and that
   * is the whole reason the word is read through `opt(ident)` instead of `attrWord`. Separate
   * alternatives fail at separate positions: `guard(op("@") ~ attrWord("assert"))` gets past the `@`
   * before it declines, and a `Failure` one token further along **outranks** an `Error` raised back
   * at the `@` — so the sentence a reader was meant to get lost to `'assert' expected` every time.
