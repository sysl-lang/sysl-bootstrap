/** The order the passes run in.
 *
 * The driver that walks a module's files and drains the work each pass queues (`analyze`), and the
 * two questions about a program's beginning that only it can answer: that there is one of them, and
 * what a declared `main` may look like.
 *
 * The order is the content. Nearly every line of `analyze` is a pass that could not have run
 * earlier, and the comments say which fact it was waiting on — a trait's supers wait for every
 * trait to be registered, a bound's check waits for the `impl` blocks below it, the module graph
 * waits for every reference to have resolved. Reading it top to bottom is reading why the compiler
 * has the phases it has.
 *
 * What each pass then *does* sits in the traits underneath, in the order the driver reaches them:
 * `ModuleFiles` (what a file contributes), `ModuleStorage` (the `val`s and `var`s it lays down),
 * `AbstractBodies` (`reference/generics.md § Bounds`'s definition-time check) and `FunctionBodies`
 * (running one, which is what the drain is draining towards).
 *
 * `units` — the files being analyzed together — is supplied by the class and declared alongside the
 * other things a walk is told about its compilation (`DeclTables`).
