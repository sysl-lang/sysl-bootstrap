/** `sysl test` — builds the `@test` functions of a source tree and runs them (`getting-started/cli.md § test`).
 *
 * **One build, one process per test.** The whole tree is compiled once, into a binary whose entry
 * point takes a test's name and runs that test alone (`Codegen.genTestMain`); the runner then starts
 * it once per test. A test that fails does so by trapping, and a trap takes its process with it — so
 * a run that shared one process would report the first failure and nothing after it. Paying for a
 * process per test buys every test a verdict, and it is the cheap half: the compile is the slow one
 * and there is only ever one of those.
 *
 * **The verdict is the exit status, and nothing else.** A test passes by returning. That is the whole
 * protocol, and it is what lets a test assert with the language it is testing rather than with a
 * framework: a broken `require`, a bounds violation, an `unwrap` of `None` — each ends the process,
 * and none of them needed to know it was running under a test. `@test(should_trap)` inverts the
 * reading for a test whose subject *is* the check.
 *
 * **A module's hooks are read against that protocol rather than beside it**
 * (`reference/attributes.md § The hooks a module may write`). `@setup` and `@teardown` run in the
 * test's own process, which is what lets a setup leave something for the test to find — and is why
 * a teardown after a test that trapped runs in a process of its own instead, there being nothing
 * left of the first one. `@setup_all` and `@teardown_all` are their own invocations, so a module
 * reaches its tests from one of them only through what outlives a process. Which part of a run
 * ended it cannot be read from an exit status, so the dispatcher marks each boundary it crosses
 * (`Tests.setupMark`).

  /** `sysl test <path>`: compile the tree as a test build, run what it holds, report.

   * A test build is **for this machine**, for the same reason `run` is — the binary is executed and
   * only this machine can execute it. A cross target is refused here rather than built and then found
   * to be unrunnable.
   *
   * `objects` is the C the walked trees carried, already compiled (`NativeSources`). A test build
   * gets it on the same footing as a `build` does, and has to: a package's tests are exactly what
   * exercises the shims it ships, so a test run that dropped them would fail at the link on the one
   * tree most likely to hold C.
   *
   * **`--std` is what lets the standard library's own tests run**, and it is the same word
   * `build-lib` uses for the same reason: the tree in front of the compiler *is* the library rather
   * than a program compiled against one. Testing sysl's own library is what a `@test` written in
   * sysl is for, and without this the tree collides with the copy the compiler supplies — every
   * declaration already declared, because it is the same declaration twice.
   *
   * `librarySources` is a library handed over as source, kept apart from `sources` rather than
   * concatenated into it because which modules are this tree's own is what decides whether a
   * dependency's export, handler, placed definition or destructor is a root
   * (`Reachability.contributing`). A test build links a `main` of its own, so it is one of the builds
   * that collision costs.
