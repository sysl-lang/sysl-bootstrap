   * `json.Parser` means that package's `json` and nothing else — which is what makes a package's
   * source read the same whoever depends on it. The leading segment is what gets qualified, because

   * unchanged.
   *
   * ==This is asked BEFORE the global question, and that order is the whole of a defect==
   *
   * Whether a segment begins a module is a question about **every** module in the compilation, so a
   * package writing its own `sh.sysl.pico.externs` was answered by an unrelated source root that
   * merely happened to supply `sh.sysl.harness`: the head named a module, the path was left
   * unqualified, and the package's own sub-module was no longer reachable from its own source. The
   * convention `§ 9` recommends is what made it certain rather than unlucky — every package
   * namespaced by reverse DNS shares the segment `sh`.
   *
   * So a path written inside a package is read against that package first. It cannot mean anything
   * else: unlike an import, which a file wrote and can rename, the prefix is added on the way in and
   * the source has no spelling for it.
   *
   * **It answers only where the qualified path leads somewhere**, which is what keeps the claim from
   * being about the segment. A package laid out at `sh/sysl/mine` owns the segment `sh` and its
   * *dependencies* are namespaced under it too — so `sh.sysl.dep.open` qualifies to a path that
   * package's tree has nothing at, and must fall through to the manifest that named the dependency
   * rather than be swallowed by the ownership claim.
   *

   *
   * **IT RE-POINTS A NAME AND NEVER CONJURES ONE, which `0.0.91` got wrong and shipped.** The
