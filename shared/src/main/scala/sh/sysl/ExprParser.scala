 * first — assignment, `||`, `&&`, chained comparison, range, `|`, `^`, `&`, additive,
 * multiplicative-and-shift, prefix, postfix. Each level is `chainl1` over the next, which iterates
 * rather than left-recurses, so associativity falls out of the combinator and the grammar stays
 * linear under packrat.

 * Two levels are deliberately not C's. Comparison **chains** rather than associates, so `a < b < c`
 * is one node and not a comparison against a `bool`. Shift binds like multiplication rather than
 * below the comparisons, which is the correction that makes `a & 1 << n` mean what it looks like.
