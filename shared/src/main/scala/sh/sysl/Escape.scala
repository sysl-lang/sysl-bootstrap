 * until the frame returns and no longer, so this pass finds the ones that could be reached
 * afterwards and rejects them.

 * function collapses to one bit per parameter — *does the callee let this argument outlive the

 * computed bottom-up over the call graph and iterated to a fixpoint, so a recursive function
