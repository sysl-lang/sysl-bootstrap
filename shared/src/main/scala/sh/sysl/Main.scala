 * A **directory** project has no extension to drop, and the name left over *is* the directory —
 * so the linker was handed a path it could not open, and `sysl build .` failed for every project
 * there has ever been while `sysl build test` failed for every project sitting in the working

 *
 * **The point is that the answer stops depending on where the build was started.** `sysl build .`,
 * `sysl build test` and `sysl build ../test` are three ways of naming one project, and all three now
 * write `test/test` rather than three different paths, one of which was the project.
 *
 * **`named` is `package.name` where the project wrote one**, and it answers the question of what a
 * directory project *is*: today a directory is a project because it happens to hold `.sysl` files,
 * and nothing gives one an identity of its own. Requiring a `package.hocon` would give every project
 * one and cost every project the ceremony — 15 directories in this repo have none, and neither does
 * a scratch directory anybody makes in thirty seconds. So a bare directory goes on building and is
 * named for itself, and a project that wants to be called something says so.
 *
