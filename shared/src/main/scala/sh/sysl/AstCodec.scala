/** The AST written out in a form built for reading back quickly, and read back into the tree the
 * parser would have produced, which is what `reference/modules.md § Separate compilation` rests on.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** A library's declarations reach a program as an abstract syntax tree, and the
 * only route to one today is the parser — a packrat combinator grammar, which memoizes every rule at
 * every position and is the slow end of practical parsing. Measured when this was written, over the
 * 592 lines of sysl the library then was: 49 ms warm and 316 ms cold, of which lexing is 11 ms, so
 * the grammar is the cost rather than the reading. The library is larger now and headed further that
 * way, and every program pays it on every compilation. This format is the same tree in a shape that
 * costs a single linear pass.
 *
 * **The shape, and why it is fast.** Every node is written as a **tag followed by its children**, and
 * a tag fixes how many children follow — so the reader never looks ahead, never backtracks, and needs
 * no memo table. Where a node holds a list, the count comes first; where it holds an option, a `0` or
 * a `1` does. Nothing is delimited, because nothing has to be: the arity is known before the children
 * are read.
 *
 * **Every string is in a table at the head and referenced by index**, which is what keeps the body to
 * integers and short tags. Identifiers repeat heavily in a tree, so the table is much smaller than the
 * strings it replaces, and a name read twice is the *same* `String` rather than two equal ones. It is
 * also what makes the body safe to split on whitespace: no token can contain any.
 *
 * **Positions are carried** rather than dropped, and the reason is worth stating: a generic library
 * declaration is monomorphized in the *program* that calls it, so the mistake a diagnostic has to
 * report is often in the caller's arguments and the line that explains it is in the library. A tree
 * with no positions could name the call and never the promise it broke. Each source's text is stored
 * alongside its name, so a decoded tree can quote its own lines with nothing else on hand.
 *
 * **What keeps the format in step with the tree.** Every encoder below is an exhaustive `match` on a
 * sealed trait, so a new AST node makes this file fail to compile cleanly rather than silently
 * writing a tree that cannot be read back. `Version` is the other half: it is stamped into the header
 * and refused on mismatch, so an artifact written by an older compiler is regenerated instead of
 * misread. **Bump it whenever a node's shape changes.**
 *
 * The format is textual on purpose, for a first cut. It is readable when something goes wrong, it
 * needs no separate schema, and the byte-level encoding can be swapped for a packed binary one behind
 * `encode`/`decode` without any caller knowing — the structure is the part that is expensive to
 * change, and it is fixed here.
 */
object AstCodec {

  /** The format's version, stamped into the header and checked on the way back in. Bump it whenever
   * the shape of any node changes, so an artifact from an older compiler is rejected rather than
   * read as something it is not.
   *
   * **Two branches bumping to the same number is the one way this check can be defeated**, and it
   * has happened once: a post-test loop and a function attribute were built in parallel, each moved
   * 15 to 16 against a tree the other had not touched, and the merge kept one 16 standing for a
   * format neither branch alone could read. An artifact stamped by either would have passed the
   * check and then been decoded as something it was not. The merge takes the next number for that
   * reason — the value has to be later than every version any compiler has ever stamped, not merely
   * later than the one this branch started from.
   *
   * **It has now happened twice, and this is the merge that took 39.** A block initializer and a
   * struct's C name were built in parallel, each moving 37 to 38 against a tree the other had not
   * touched. Caught by reading dev's value rather than by anything failing — which is the point
   * worth keeping: the collision is invisible to the compiler, because both numbers are perfectly
   * valid on their own branch.
   *
   * **Three times, and 40 is the vector branch's.** `VectorType` moved 37 to 38 in parallel with
   * *both* of the above, so by the time it fetched dev the number it had taken was two behind.
   * This one was caught by `git merge` raising a conflict on the line rather than by anybody
   * reading — which is luck rather than a mechanism, and only happened because the branch that took
   * 39 edited the same line. **Two branches that bump this from different starting values do not
   * conflict**, and that is the case the rule above is written for: read dev's number, take the one
   * after it, and do not assume a clean merge means the versions agree.
