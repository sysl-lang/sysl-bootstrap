/** The `@test` functions a program declares, and what separates a test build from every other one
 * (`reference/attributes.md § What is dropped, and when`).
 *
 * A test is an ordinary function with an attribute on it. That is the whole of the language part:
 * nothing about the body is special, it may call anything the module can reach, and it is analyzed
 * and type-checked exactly as it would be without the line above it. What the attribute buys is a
 * *caller* — `sysl test` builds an entry point that calls one of them by name, and the program's own
 * entry point is not built at all.
 *
 * **A test is not part of the program it is written in.** `sysl run`, `sysl build` and
 * `sysl emit-llvm` all drop them, and drop them *after* analysis, so a test that does not compile is
 * still a compilation error in a build that would never have run it. That is what lets a test sit
 * beside what it tests: a library's tests do not travel in the library, and a program's do not run
 * when it runs.
 *
 * **`sysl build-lib` is the exception, and drops them before analysis instead** — `stripSource`
 * rather than `strip`. An artifact is the one output that outlives the compilation that made it, and
 * analyzing a test body is enough to change what it holds: a test over a `Buf[int]` monomorphizes
 * the whole of `Buf` at `int`, and those instantiations are ordinary library functions by the time
 * `strip` runs, so nothing downstream can tell them from ones the library asked for. Stripping the
 * declarations first is what keeps an artifact's contents a fact about the library rather than about
 * its tests.
 *
 * **The line this draws is between PARSING and ANALYSIS, and it is worth stating exactly**, because
 * "`build-lib` no longer checks a library's tests" is wrong in both directions. `LibraryArtifact.build`
 * parses every source and returns on the first `Left` before `compileLibrary` is reached, so a
 * **syntax** error in a `@tests` file still stops the build. What such a file no longer gets is
 * everything *after* the parse — name resolution, types, visibility, capabilities, the `@test`
 * well-formedness checks `problem` and `resultProblem` make from `Hoisting`, generic instantiation,
 * escape analysis, the tail-call check. Not merely type-checking.
 *
 * So what is given up is narrower than it sounds and sharper: a library test that is *well-formed
 * text* and wrong in every other way builds clean. `sysl test --std` compiles the library's tests
 * properly and runs them, and the suite runs that — a better place for the check than a command
 * whose subject is the artifact.

  /** The byte the test dispatcher writes to standard error once `@setup` has returned

  /** The same program with every test and every test file dropped — the tree a build that is not

   * Dropping the functions is what keeps a test out of the output; dropping the list is what keeps
   * anything downstream from believing there are tests to dispatch to. Both, because either alone is
   * a tree that contradicts itself.
   *
   * **A `@tests` file goes with them, and this is the one place that can drop it.** A test's callees
   * needed no help while every build that could reach one was a program: a helper only a test calls
   * becomes unreachable the moment the test does, and `Reachability.prune` notices. A **library**
   * prunes nothing — it has no `main` to lower outwards from, so every public declaration is emitted
   * (`Compiler.compileLibrary`) — and a helper would ride into the artifact and be advertised out of
   * it. Naming the file is what answers that, since a file is what the author marked.
   *
   * Dropping it here is safe rather than lucky: `TestScope` has already held every reference into
   * such a file to coming from something dropped in the same builds, so what is left behind can
   * hold no reference to what went.
   *
   * The **types** it declared are left, exactly as `Reachability.prune` leaves them: a type is
   * emitted for its layout rather than for anything that runs, so an unused one costs a definition
   * nothing reads and no code at all.
   *
   * **A method table is not**, and it is the one thing here that has to go with a function rather
   * than outlive it. A closure lowered inside a test body is dropped with the test (`testOnlyDecls`
   * carries the name the compiler gave it), and the table registering it as an implementation of
   * `Fn` would otherwise be left pointing at a function no longer in the tree — which `prune` cannot
   * repair, since a table is one of its *roots*: it would follow the slot and keep the body, and the
   * body names the helpers that have just gone. Dropping the table is what makes the removal
   * complete, and it can catch nothing else: an `impl` may not sit in a `@tests` file, so the only

   * is not what `sysl test` does — so they are dropped, and what remains of the entry point is the

   * The tests are the **roots**, in place of the `main` that is no longer there, so that everything
   * one of them calls survives the pruning and nothing else does. A program whose tests reach half
   * of it compiles half of it, which is the same bargain every other build gets.
   *
   * **`Reachability.entryPoints` is a root here for the same reason it is one there**, and leaving it
   * out is a bug this build had: a handler, an export and a destructor are each reached from
   * somewhere this walk cannot see, so replacing the roots does not make them reachable from the
   * tests instead — it makes them reachable from nothing. A destructor pruned that way still has the
   * release hook calling it, so a package with one could not link its own suite; an export pruned
   * that way goes quietly, and the package's C is what discovers it.
   *
   * `own` carries through to the same place for the same reason: a test build links a `main` of its
   * own, so a dependency's unreached `@export("main")` would fight it exactly as it fights a
   * program's.
   *
   * **And it is WIDENED by the modules whose tests this build runs, which is what `own` means here.**
   * The tests are the roots, so a module that contributes one is a module this compilation is
   * *producing* rather than one it merely links — and a test build keeps every `@test` in the tree, a
   * dependency's as readily as the project's. Without the widening, a package whose own suite makes a
   * value with a destructor put that instantiation into a consumer's test build while
   * `Reachability.contributing` answered for the **program's** module graph, which reaches neither the
   * package nor its tests: the release hook was emitted and the body pruned. What a reader got was
   * `use of undefined value '@pkg$T.drop'` out of clang — a symbol no line of their program mentions,
   * in a package they need never have imported, and only when the package's tests were the one thing
   * that made the value.
   *
   * It stays one rule for all four kinds, and it makes a consumer's test build agree with the one the
