// The command line: what a `Config` holds, the parser that fills one in, and the three
// subcommands whose whole answer is text on stdout. Held apart from the driver because it is
// the half a reader consults to find out what sysl *accepts* rather than what it does.

/** The sysl command-line driver. It reads a module's source files, runs the pure front end and
 * codegen from the shared module, and drives an LLVM toolchain to link and run the result. Filesystem
 * and process access go through `cross_platform`, so the same driver ships as a native binary
 * and as a Node CLI (the JVM build is for a fast development loop).
 *
 * Each subcommand takes a **path**, which is a **project root** or a single file. A module is a
 * directory and its name is that directory's path relative to the root (`reference/modules.md`), so
 * naming a directory compiles the whole tree under it — one module per directory, each holding its
 * files to the name its location gives it — and naming a file compiles that file alone.
 *
 * Subcommands:
 *   - `sysl run <path>`            compile and execute
 *   - `sysl build <path> -o x`     compile to a native executable
 *   - `sysl build-lib <path> -o x` compile a library to a linkable artifact
 *   - `sysl emit-llvm <path>`      print the generated LLVM IR
 *   - `sysl weave <path>`          render a literate source as an HTML document
 *   - `sysl tangle <path>`         print the program a literate source holds
 *   - `sysl deps <path>`           print the resolved dependency graph
 *   - `sysl add <coordinate>`      add a dependency to this project's manifest
 *   - `sysl vendor <path>`         put what this project depends on into vendor/
 *   - `sysl targets`               list the machines sysl can build for
 *
 * **`--lib` takes either a source tree or an artifact**, and which one is read off the name: a
 * `.syslib` is decoded, anything else is walked as source. That is deliberate — how a library was
 * shipped is the shipper's business, and a program that depends on one should not have to write down
 * which it got. `build-lib` is what turns the first into the second, and the only difference
 * downstream is what the compilation *cost*: an artifact is a linear decode where source is a parse.
 *
 * **An artifact is an `ar` archive** (`LibraryArtifact`), so it reaches the linker as it stands and
 * only the members that resolve something are pulled in. Building one therefore needs an `llvm-ar`
 * as well as a `clang`; `--ar` names it where it is somewhere a search would not look.
 *
 * **The standard module's own source is read off disk**, from the library installed with this
 * compiler — `<prefix>/share/sysl/library` beside the binary, or `library/` in a checkout (`Std.root`).
 * There is no copy inside the executable: a library nobody can open is not one anybody can learn
 * from or edit, which is what every other toolchain concluded too.
 *
 * **`--std-lib` is the same thing for the standard module** as `--lib` is for any other, and every
 * program is compiled against it whether or not one is named. Built by `build-lib --std` and given
 * back here, it replaces the parse of that source: the signatures arrive decoded, and the half that
 * was already compiled is linked rather than emitted a second time into every program.
 *
 * **It need not be given, and it need not already exist.** `build-lib --std` with no `-o` writes to
 * `LibraryArtifact.stdDefault`, and a compilation with no `--std-lib` looks there — one path at both
 * ends. Where nothing usable is at that path the compiler **builds one**, from the library source,
 * and says so on stderr. The artifact is derived rather than authored: not committed, object code
 * for one machine, and computed entirely from the source beside the compiler, so being absent after
 * a clone or stale after a format change has one answer and it is not a question for whoever ran the
 * command. It sits in the user's cache under a fingerprint of the library it was built from, so
 * every project on a machine shares one and a compiler installed with a different library gets a
 * path of its own rather than a stale hit.
 *
 * **Which is not the same as substituting a library.** What a compiler must never do is answer *I
 * could not find the library you meant* by quietly using a different one — and a rebuild uses **this**
 * one, held to `Std.fingerprint` on the way back in. A `--std-lib` that was named and cannot be read
 * still stops the compilation, because there the reader asked for a particular artifact and is owed
 * the truth about it.
 *
 * **`--no-std-lib` is the one route to the library as source**, ignoring whatever artifact is on
 * disk. Compiling it rather than linking it is what makes bootstrap possible — there is no released
 * sysl to build the first artifact with — so it is reached deliberately rather than by a lookup
 * coming up empty. Taken silently it would be taken always, because then nobody would have any
 * reason to build an artifact at all.
 *
 * **`build-c` and `emit-header` are the exception and take the source unasked**, because what they
 * write is read by a C linker and a `.syslib` is not something one can be given. That is a property
 * of the consumer rather than a preference, which is why it is not left to a flag.
 *
 * **Everything after a bare `--` belongs to the program being run**, not to sysl: it is passed
 * straight through to the executable, which is what lets `sysl run prog.sysl -- -v file` reach a
 * `main(args: []string)` without sysl having to decide whether `-v` was meant for it. The split is
 * made before the options are parsed, which is why an argument that looks like one of sysl's own is
 * still the program's.
 *
 * `--explain-escapes` may be given to any of them: it reports, on stderr, every local array the
 * compiler moved to the heap and the view that forced it (`05`).
 *
 * `--target` names the machine to build for (`getting-started/cli.md § targets`). Given none, a
 * build is for the machine it is running on — and if that is one sysl has no entry for, it says so
 * and stops rather than guessing, because a wrong guess produces a module that looks right and is
 * not.
 *
 * `--optimize` names the level handed to clang, spelled as clang spells one after the `-O`, and it
 * reaches every object a build produces rather than only the link. The default is `1` rather than
 * nothing at all, which is what it used to be: `-O0` is a different instruction selector, it is the
 * mode a back end's own suite covers least, and a miscompile was found living there
 * (`Toolchain.defaultOptimization` has the case). A level clang does not have is clang's to report.
 *
 * **A project states its own level in its manifest** (`PackageConfig.optimization`), and the flag
 * beats the key for the invocation that carries it: a project built at `2` is still profiled at `0`
 * by typing it, and neither answer has to be repeated on every command line to hold.
