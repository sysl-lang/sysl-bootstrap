 *
 * Three layers are underneath it, each holding one concern of what "the analyzer's state" means:
 * `Reporting`, which is how a mistake is raised and recovered from; `DeclTables`, which is what the
 * program is made of; and `Scoping`, which is what a name written at a given place means. This one
 * adds the state of the **body being analyzed right now** — its result type, its type substitution,
 * the loops it is inside, the nested functions and captures it can see — all of which is put back
 * at every function boundary, and none of which outlives the body it belongs to.
 *
 * It also declares the recursive entry points that live in the `Analyzer` class but are called from
 * every trait, as abstract hooks — exactly as `Emitter` declares `genExpr` for the codegen traits.
 *
 * What none of the four holds is the reading of the tables. Asking what members a type has, whether
 * it satisfies a bound and through which implementation, and what to say when it does not, is
 * `TraitLookup` — which extends this and which everything else reaches through.
