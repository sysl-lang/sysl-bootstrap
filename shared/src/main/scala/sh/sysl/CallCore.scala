 * It sits at the bottom of the call layering because the three things above it — a method, an
 * operator, a constructor — are all a free call underneath. The analyzer lowers every member to a
 * function under the mangled name `Type.member`, so a method call is a free call whose first
 * argument is the receiver, and an operator is a method call whose name came from a token. That is
 * why the checking lives here once rather than three times.
 *
 * Argument checking runs **provisionally** first where a callee is generic: the arguments have to be
 * analyzed to solve the type parameters, and solving them is what says whether the arguments were
 * right. `probe` is what makes that recoverable — an attempt that fails leaves no diagnostic behind,
 * so an overload set can be tried without the failures reaching the programmer.

   * `fitSignature`.
   *
   * The first two are about **exactness**, and both exist because a call that fits two declarations
   * usually fits one of them the way it was written and the other by something the language did for
   * it.
   *
   * 1. **A candidate that needed no default fitted the call as written.** `f(x: int)` and
   *    `f(x: int, y: int = 0)` both take `f(1)`, and the reader who wrote `f(1)` meant the first.
   * 2. **A candidate whose parameters are exactly the arguments' own types** beats one reached by a
   *    conversion. This is what makes a literal's natural type decide between two widths, and it is
   *    asked of the types the fit settled on rather than of the types the declaration wrote — so
   *    `g[T](x: T)` is exact at a `[]int` argument and beats `g(s: []const int)`, which is reached
   *    only by giving up the ability to write.
   * 3. **A candidate that named its parameters beats one that was solved for them**, where both
   *    fitted at the same types. `f(x: int)` beside `f[T](x: T)` at `f(0)` fits both at `int`, and
   *    a generic declaration is the one that took the call by being told what to be. Without this
   *    the second tie-break would turn that call — which resolves today — into an ambiguity, so it
   *    is a guard rather than a preference.
   *
   * What is deliberately *not* here is a rule ranking one conversion above another. Two candidates
   * each reached by a different conversion are ambiguous, and saying so is better than a ladder of
   * precedences nobody can predict from the source. Ranking a declaration against a declaration, as
   * the third does, is a different question from ranking the routes the arguments took.
   *
   * **THE THIRD ASKS ITS QUESTION OF A POOL, AND THE POOL IS NOT ALWAYS THE EXACT ONES.** It read
   * `exactTypes` until card `0369`, so it was skipped outright whenever *no* candidate was exact —
   * which is every call reached by a conversion. `g(x: []u8)` beside `g[T](x: []T)` resolves at a
   * `[]u8` argument and was ambiguous at a `[3]u8` one, on the same two declarations fitted at the
   * same signature, because the array had to be viewed to reach either.
   *
   * The widening is bounded by the paragraph above rather than by a new principle: where the
   * candidates all fitted at **identical** parameter types, they took identical routes, so choosing
   * between them ranks nothing but the declarations. Candidates that fitted at different types stay
   * ambiguous, since telling them apart would be ranking the conversions.

   * subscript everywhere else in the language and the parser is not the thing that knows what `f`
   * is. So what arrives is an expression to be read back as the type it was written as, and the
   * shapes that survive the round trip are the ones a type and an expression spell identically: a
   * name, a qualified name, a name applied to arguments, `*T`, `&T`, a tuple, and an integer for a
   * value parameter (`reference/generics.md § A parameter may stand for a value`).
   *
   * **The rest are refused by name rather than misread.** A slice, a `weak`, a `volatile`, a vector
   * and a callable have spellings the expression grammar has no production for, so there is nothing
   * here to recover them from. That is a hole in this form and not in the language: an annotation on
   * what receives the value still reaches every one of them, which is what the message says to write.
