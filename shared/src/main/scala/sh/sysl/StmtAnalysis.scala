     *
     * **It is settled here rather than deferred**, and the two paths do not overlap: a module file's
     * asserts are declarations, are collected by hoisting, and are checked by the walk over
     * `assertDecls`; one written in the entry file is a statement, is never hoisted, and would
     * otherwise be checked by nobody. Both settle after every constant has folded, which is the one
     * ordering the condition needs — it may name a constant declared below it.
     *
     * It emits nothing either way: a true assertion is not code, and a false one has already
     * stopped the compilation.
     *
     * **`tsubst` is what makes one inside a generic mean anything** (`reference/generics.md §
     * Monomorphization`). A body is analyzed once per instantiation with its parameters bound to
     * the arguments, so the condition is settled against the types that were actually chosen —
     * which is the only moment `sizeof(T)` is a number. Folding against an empty map instead
     * reported `T` as an unknown type, about a parameter declared a line above.
