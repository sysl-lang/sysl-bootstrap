/** Lowers a typed program (`TProgram`) to a textual LLVM IR module.
 *
 * Codegen makes no semantic decisions — the analyzer has already resolved every name, fixed
 * every type, and checked every rule. This pass is a straight translation: it selects
 * instructions from the types the tree carries and lays out basic blocks. Opaque pointers and
 * hex-double float constants keep the output stable across the textual round-trip.
 *
 * The work is split across traits the way the analyzer's is: `Emitter` holds the buffers, block
 * state, and name counters, `ArcEmitter` the ownership runtime, `StringEmitter` and `ScalarEmitter`
 * the two ends of the value world, `PlaceEmitter` addressing and composite values,
 * `ControlFlowEmitter` everything that makes a basic block, `StaticEmitter` the module-level storage
 * that is laid down before any block exists, `ForeignEmitter` the C boundary, `ContractEmitter`
 * everything that traps, `EnumAttrEmitter` the simple-enum attributes, `CallEmitter` the call seam
 * and the writers that put a large value straight where it is going to live, `ArithEmitter`
 * arithmetic and the scalar conversions, and `ExprEmitter` the expression dispatch they all call
 * back into.
 *
 * What stays here is the spine, which is the part that needs the whole program rather than one
 * expression: the module's assembly in declaration order, the two function forms, and statements —
 * the only level at which a temporary's lifetime is decided.

   *
   * **One test to a process, chosen from outside.** A test that fails does so by trapping, and a trap
   * takes the process with it — so a runner that called them in a loop would learn the name of the
   * first failure and nothing after it. Dispatching on an argument instead means one compile and one
   * short-lived process per test, and a test's verdict is then the exit status the platform already
   * reports.
   *
   * The status says which of three things happened, and the runner reads all three: `0` for a test
   * that returned, whatever the platform makes of a trap for one that did not, and `2` for a name
   * that matches nothing here — which is a runner and a binary that disagree, not a test result.
   *
   * The computed `val`s are laid down first, exactly as an ordinary entry point lays them down. A
   * test reads a module's storage the same way any other function does, and skipping the
   * initialization here would leave it reading zeros.
   *
   * **A hook gets an arm of its own as well as a place in the arms of the tests it brackets**
   * (`reference/attributes.md § The hooks a module may write`). The two are different requests: the
   * runner asks for `setup_all` by name and gets a process that runs it and nothing else, and it
   * asks for a test by name and gets `setup(); test(); teardown()` in one process, because a setup
   * that ran somewhere else would leave the test's own module storage untouched.

   * root.
