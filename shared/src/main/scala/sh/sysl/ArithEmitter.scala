/** Arithmetic, comparison, and the conversions between scalar widths.
 *
 * Two things run through all of it. The first is that a **constrained** type is laid out as its
 * base and computes as its base — the subtype names a set of values, not a second way to add — so
 * `a += e` and `a = a + e` reach the same instruction by different routes and must agree about it.
 *
 * The second is that overflow checking is **opt-in and narrow**. Arithmetic on raw integers is
 * defined to wrap, so the checked form is in play only when an operand came through a ranged
 * (`within`) type, and only then when the exact interval the operands allow can fall outside the
 * base width. `overflowChecked` computes that interval rather than guessing at it, which is what
 * keeps a small counter or an index on the plain path at no cost.
 *
 * Where a type has no instruction for what is being asked, the operator's trait method stands in
 * (`reference/expressions.md § Operator dispatch`). `dispatchValue` is that path, and it applies a
 * method to two **values** rather than two expressions — which is the whole distinction from
 * lowering an ordinary call: the forms that reach it use one operand twice from a single
 * evaluation.
