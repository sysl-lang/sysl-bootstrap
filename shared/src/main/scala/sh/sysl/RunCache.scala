/** The executable `sysl run` built last time, kept so that running the same program twice costs the
 * second one nothing (card `0309`).
 *
 * **The measurement it was filed on.** `sysl run . -- hello.sl` in a 9,600-line module with three
 * git dependencies took **9.2 seconds for a program whose body is `print("hi")`**, and the same 9.2
 * seconds whatever the program did; the built binary ran the same hello-world in 0.004. So the whole
 * of that was compilation, repeated on every invocation with nothing changed between them — and it
 * hides inside what looks like the program's own cost. Four timings taken while benchmarking a
 * collector read 9.6–10.1 seconds and appeared to say the workloads were indistinguishable; they
 * were 9.2 seconds of rebuild plus 0.02–0.9 seconds of work, and the real ratio was about 45x.
 *
 * ==What the key is over, and why it is long==
 *
 * **Getting a cache key wrong is a stale-binary bug, which is worse than a slow build**, so this errs
 * toward rebuilding: everything that can reach the bytes is in the key, and anything that cannot be
 * cheaply established is a miss rather than a guess.
 *
 *   - the **compiler**, by version. Two releases never share an entry, exactly as they never share a
 *     standard-module entry, and for the same reason: an executable is compiled code, so a release
 *     that changes what a program lowers to while touching none of its source produces different
 *     bytes at an identical fingerprint.
 *   - the **target**, the **allocator** pair and the **optimization level**, each of which changes
 *     what is emitted. The level is the one the build resolved rather than the one `-O` named
 *     (`Config.optimization`), so a project that raises its manifest's `optimization` rebuilds on the
 *     next run instead of replaying a binary built at the old level from an unchanged tree.
 *   - every **source file** the program is made of — its own, every `--lib` source root's, and the C
 *     each of those trees carries — by `LibraryArtifact.fingerprint`, which is over each file's place
 *     in its tree and its text.
 *   - every **artifact** named with `--lib`, by its bytes.
 *   - the **standard module** it compiles against, by whichever of the three it is: a named
 *     `--std-lib`, the library's own fingerprint, or the from-source build `--no-std-lib` asks for.
 *   - the **search paths** and the **link line**, which decide what the C compiler and the linker do
 *     with input this key has otherwise covered.
 *   - the **environment that reaches the toolchain** (`Toolchain.buildEnvironment`) — the extra
 *     clang flags, and the variables naming a cross toolchain. This is the only part of the key
 *     that is neither the command line nor the tree, and it was **missing until card `0415`**: a
 *     run under `SYSL_EXTRA_CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"` over an unchanged tree replayed the
 *     uninstrumented binary the previous ordinary run had left in the slot and reported green.
 *
 * **What is deliberately NOT in it: the program's own arguments.** `sysl run p -- a b` and
 * `sysl run p -- c d` are one binary run twice, which is the whole point.
 *
 * ==What it does not cover, stated rather than hidden==
 *
 * A **development tree**, where the compiler changes under a constant `BuildInfo.version`. Nothing in
 * a cache can distinguish those without hashing the compiler itself, and it is the same hole the
 * standard-module cache has and names. `SYSL_NO_CACHE` is the escape hatch, and a `sysl build`
 * never consults this at all.
 *
 * An **`#include`d header** outside the trees this hashes, which a `c const` block or a vendored C
 * file may reach. The same is true of the standard-module cache, and the same answer applies.
