/** Who may name what a `@tests` file declares (`reference/attributes.md § @tests — a file of scaffolding`).
 *
 * The header says two things and this is the second of them. The first — that every build but a test
 * build drops the file — is `Tests.strip`'s, and on its own it would be unsound: a program that
 * called a helper would compile here and fail at the link, with a message about a missing symbol
 * rather than about the line that named it.
 *
 * So the rule is stated over the **referring declaration** rather than over the file it sits in:
 *
 *   - a declaration in a `@tests` file may name another, since the two are dropped together;
 *   - a `@test` function may name one wherever it was written, because `reference/attributes.md § @tests — a file of scaffolding` puts a test
 *     beside what it tests and `Tests.strip` drops it in the same builds;
 *   - a hook may name one for the same reason it is dropped by the same builds
 *     (`reference/attributes.md § The hooks a module may write`) — a `@setup` exists to prepare what
 *     the module's tests are written against, so the scaffolding they may name is the scaffolding it
 *     may name;
 *   - anything else may not, and is told so where it wrote the name.
 *
 * **A closure is judged by the body it was written in, not by the name it was filed under.** It is
 * lowered to a function of its own under a name no reader wrote, so on its own terms it belongs to
 * no file and would be held to the third rule while sitting inside something the first two exempt —
 * a lambda in a test naming that test's own helper, reported as though a shipped function had named
 * it. `Closures.lowerClosure` answers that where the answer is still known, by putting the lowered
 * name into `testOnlyDecls` when the enclosing body is one a test build keeps. That makes the
 * exemption and the drop the same fact rather than two that have to agree.
 *
 * **A generic's instantiation is judged by the file its declaration is in**, for the same reason: it
 * is filed under a mangled name no file wrote. `instantiateFunc` puts that name into `testOnlyDecls`
 * wherever the generic's is, so a helper taking a callable may call the helper beside it, and an
 * ordinary file calling such a generic is told so at its own call rather than inside the test file.
 *
 * That the two halves agree is what makes the drop safe rather than lucky: every reference into a
 * test file comes from something dropped in exactly the builds the file is, so a tree that has been
 * stripped can hold no reference to anything that went with it.
 *
 * **Asked of the typed tree**, for the reason `Purity`'s question is: a name reaches a declaration
 * through a dozen paths in the analyzer — a call, an operator that lowered to one, a function's
 * address, a read of module storage — and a guard at each is a list a thirteenth path would quietly
 * not join. A reference is a *node*, so the nodes are the whole answer.

   *
   * A **lowered** closure is in the set and is not, and the case that says why is a generic taking a

   * closure's type, and the `lt(…)` inside that instantiation is a direct call on the closure's body.
   * The instantiation is an ordinary library function by then, so the walk arrives at it — and what it
   * would say is that `$closure4.call` may not be named here, which is a name the program does not
   * contain and the reader cannot go and look at.
   *
   * **Nothing is given up by staying quiet.** The rule exists so that a stripped tree holds no
   * reference to what went, and an instantiation keyed on a test's closure type can only have been
   * demanded by that test — so it goes when the test does, which is `Reachability.prune`'s answer
   * rather than this pass's. What is left for this pass is exactly the names a reader wrote.
