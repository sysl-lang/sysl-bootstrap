   * `impl Show for Point`, and which types an `impl` may be *for* is the analyzer's to decide
   * rather than something to leave the grammar unable to express.
   *
   * The block may declare **type parameters of its own**, in the same bracketed list a generic
   * function writes and in the same position — directly after the keyword that opens the
   * declaration: `impl[T: Show] Show for Box[T]`. They are what makes the implementation cover a
   * generic type as a whole, and the bounds on them are what make it conditional.
   *
   * The body itself is optional, because a trait whose every method has a default leaves a
   * conforming type nothing to write: `impl Zero for E` on its own line is the whole of that
   * implementation, and the opt-in it states is the point of writing it.
   *
   * The block may be marked **`override`** (`reference/traits.md § override — when the overlap is deliberate`), which says it deliberately replaces a
   * more general implementation already covering the same type. The keyword goes in front of `impl`
   * rather than anywhere inside, because what it qualifies is the block as a whole.
