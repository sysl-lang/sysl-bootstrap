 * program spells that width nowhere else.
 *
 * `cname` is `@export` written above it (`reference/ffi.md § Naming a type`): the name a generated C
 * header gives the type in a `typedef`, and spells it by wherever it appears. **An exported alias is
 * not an alias either**, for `fromC`'s reason — the header has to know where the name was written,
 * so the type keeps its name rather than dissolving into its base. It is still transparent: a value

 * `bounds` is what the trait asks of those parameters, exactly as a struct's are.
 *
 * `supers` are the traits this one **requires**, written after the name as a bound is written:
 * `trait Word: Add + BitXor`. A supertrait is a promise the trait itself makes, so an `impl` supplies
 * it and everything that names the trait — a bound, a trait object — gets the required traits'
 * members along with its own.
 *
 * `tdefaults` are the `= Type` clauses of `trait Mul[Rhs = Self]`, keyed by the parameter they
 * belong to. A trait is one of the three declarations whose arguments are *written* where it is
 * applied, so a default has somewhere to stand in — the others are a struct and an enum. The

 * `forType` just the same, from the body the trait supplied.
 *
 * `forType` is a full type reference rather than a name, because a trait may be implemented for a

 *
 * `overrides` is the `override` keyword written in front of the block (`reference/traits.md § override — when the overlap is deliberate`), which says
 * it deliberately replaces a more general implementation that already covers the same type —
 * `override impl Display for []Point` against the library's `impl[T: Display] Display for []T`.
